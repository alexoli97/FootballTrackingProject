# FootballTrackingProject

This project focuses on developing a model trained using the football-players-detection dataset. The primary goal is to accurately identify and mark the current ball location and the player currently in possession during a football match. This is achieved by utilizing advanced machine learning techniques and computer vision algorithms.
